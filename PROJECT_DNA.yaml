# Oktyv Project DNA
# Version: 0.1.0-alpha.1
# Created: 2026-01-22
# Philosophy: Option B Perfection - Do It Right First Time

identity:
  name: "Oktyv"
  tagline: "Complete, production-grade authoritative agent browser automation system"
  purpose: |
    Universal automation layer giving AI agents the ability to ACT on the real world.
    Complete automation infrastructure with 7 core engines: Browser, API, Database,
    Email, File, Cron, and Credential Vault. Oktyv is the "hands" of all AI products,
    enabling autonomous web interaction, API orchestration, data persistence, and
    scheduled workflows across any platform.
  philosophy: |
    Option B Perfection - Build complete product first time, not MVP iterations.
    Foundation Out - Build backend infrastructure before surface features.
    Zero Technical Debt - No mocks, stubs, or temporary solutions.
    Cognitive Monopoly - Context and intelligence as competitive advantage.
    Lean Infrastructure - Use existing tools, build only what's unique.

boundaries:
  does:
    - "Browser automation (Puppeteer) ✅ Phase 1"
    - "API orchestration (HTTP/REST/GraphQL) 📋 Phase 2"
    - "Database operations (SQL/NoSQL) 📋 Phase 3"
    - "Email automation (send/receive/parse) 📋 Phase 4"
    - "File operations (local + cloud storage) 📋 Phase 5"
    - "Scheduled automation (cron) 📋 Phase 6"
    - "Credential vault (encrypted storage) 📋 Phase 7"
    - "Workflow orchestration (multi-engine) 📋 Phase 8"
    - "Session persistence across restarts"
    - "Platform-specific connectors (LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.)"
    - "Rate limiting per platform/engine"
    - "Error recovery and retry logic"
  does_not:
    - "Store user credentials in plain text"
    - "Manage application state (that's GREGORE)"
    - "Provide AI analysis (that's Claude's job)"
    - "Replace domain-specific systems"
    - "Bundle as KERNL plugin (standalone MCP server)"
    - "Run as browser extension"

interfaces:
  - workspace: "Any MCP Client"
    relationship: "Browser automation provider"
    connection: "MCP protocol via Claude Desktop or API"
    data_flow: "Oktyv → Claude → Client application"
    
  - workspace: "KERNL"
    relationship: "Development tooling"
    connection: "Session management, file operations"
    data_flow: "KERNL manages Oktyv development"

key_decisions:
  - date: "2026-01-22"
    decision: "Standalone MCP server, not KERNL plugin"
    rationale: |
      - Single responsibility (browser automation only)
      - Easier to test in isolation
      - Large Puppeteer dependencies (~300MB)
      - Usable beyond Career System
      - Simpler deployment and versioning
      
  - date: "2026-01-22"
    decision: "Puppeteer over Playwright"
    rationale: |
      - Simpler API for MCP use case
      - Smaller footprint
      - Better Node.js integration
      - Sufficient for LinkedIn/Indeed
      - Can migrate if multi-browser needed
      
  - date: "2026-01-22"
    decision: "Cookie-based session persistence"
    rationale: |
      - User stays logged in across invocations
      - No credential management needed
      - Mirrors real browser behavior
      - Respects platform security
      
  - date: "2026-01-22"
    decision: "Platform-agnostic canonical data schema"
    rationale: |
      - Career System independent of LinkedIn specifics
      - Easy to add new platforms
      - Consistent Claude experience
      - Future-proof design

naming:
  etymology: |
    "Oktyv" combines "oct" (eight, suggesting completeness) with modern tech aesthetic.
    Represents eight-fold path: discover, filter, extract, analyze, apply, track, follow-up, succeed.

    - "Fetch" (unicorn company $2.5B conflict)
    - "Invoke" (multiple established companies)
    - "Argus" (major real estate software $143M raised)
    - "Sidecar" (extremely crowded namespace)
    - "Octave" (major Hexagon spinoff 2026)
